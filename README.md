# Rexko
## Let's make dictionaries!

## Getting started
Assuming you have Ruby (3.1.2), gem, & bundler installed.

1. Clone or [download](https://github.com/Rexko/rexko/archive/master.zip) and unzip where you like.
2. In your Rexko folder do:  
    `bundle`  
    `rake db:schema:load RAILS_ENV=production`  
    `rake assets:precompile`  
    `rails server -e production`
3. Pull up a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to access your installation.
4. Click on the "Languages" tab and set up the languages you'll be working with (e.g. English and the language you're describing).
5. Click on the "Dictionaries" tab and create a dictionary.

Now you can start adding lexemes (dictionary entries) or loci (attestations).
